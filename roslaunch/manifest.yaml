description: "roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS <a href=\"http://ros.org/wiki/Nodes\"\
  >nodes</a> locally and remotely\n    via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the\
  \ <a href=\"http://ros.org/wiki/Parameter Server\">Parameter\n    Server</a>. It\
  \ includes options to automatically respawn processes\n    that have already died.\
  \ roslaunch takes in one or more XML\n    configuration files (with the <tt>.launch</tt>\
  \ extension) that\n    specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well\
  \ as the\n    machines that they should be run on."
