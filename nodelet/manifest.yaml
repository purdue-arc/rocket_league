description: "The nodelet package is designed to provide a way to run multiple\n \
  \   algorithms in the same process with zero copy transport between\n    algorithms.\n\
  \n    This package provides both the nodelet base class needed for\n    implementing\
  \ a nodelet, as well as the NodeletLoader class used\n    for instantiating nodelets."
