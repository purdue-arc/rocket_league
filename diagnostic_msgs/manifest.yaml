description: "This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the\n    standardized\
  \ interface for the diagnostic and runtime monitoring\n    systems in ROS. These\
  \ messages are currently used by\n    the <a href=\"http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics\"\
  >diagnostics</a>\n    Stack, which provides libraries for simple ways to set and\
  \ access\n    the messages, as well as automated ways to process the diagnostic\n\
  \    data.\n\n    These messages are used for long term logging and will not be\n\
  \    changed unless there is a very important reason."
