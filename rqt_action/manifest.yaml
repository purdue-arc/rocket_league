description: "rqt_action provides a feature to introspect all available ROS\n  action\
  \ (from actionlib) types. By utilizing rqt_msg, the output format is\n  unified\
  \ with it and rqt_srv. Note that the actions shown on this plugin\n  is the ones\
  \ that are stored on your machine, not on the ROS core your rqt\n  instance connects\
  \ to."
