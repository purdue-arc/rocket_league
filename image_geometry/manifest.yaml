description: "`image_geometry` contains C++ and Python libraries for interpreting\
  \ images\n    geometrically. It interfaces the calibration parameters in sensor_msgs/CameraInfo\n\
  \    messages with OpenCV functions such as image rectification, much as cv_bridge\n\
  \    interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV data types."
