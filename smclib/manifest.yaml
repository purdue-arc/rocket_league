description: "The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/\n\
  \    converts a language-independent description of a state machine\n    into the\
  \ source code to support that state machine.\n\n    This package contains the libraries\
  \ that a compiled state machine\n    depends on, but it does not contain the compiler\
  \ itself."
