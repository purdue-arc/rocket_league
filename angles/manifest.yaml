description: "This package provides a set of simple math utilities to work\n     \
  \   with angles. The utilities cover simple things like\n        normalizing an\
  \ angle and conversion between degrees and\n        radians. But even if you're\
  \ trying to calculate things like\n        the shortest angular distance between\
  \ two joint space\n        positions of your robot, but the joint motion is constrained\n\
  \        by joint limits, this package is what you need. The code in\n        this\
  \ package is stable and well tested. There are no plans for\n        major changes\
  \ in the near future."
