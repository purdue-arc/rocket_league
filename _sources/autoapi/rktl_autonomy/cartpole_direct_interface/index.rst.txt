:py:mod:`rktl_autonomy.cartpole_direct_interface`
=================================================

.. py:module:: rktl_autonomy.cartpole_direct_interface

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Cartpole is a very simple environment included within OpenAI Gym. There is not
   much of a reason to use it, except for verifying the functionality of this
   library. Two different interfaces are provided, `CartpoleInterface` and
   `CartpoleDirectInterface`. The former uses the `ROSInterface` class and the
   latter directly owns the Gym environment. To verify the `ROSInterface` worked,
   it was confirmed that they both behave the same way.
