description: "An rqt-based tool that assists monitoring tasks\n   for <a href=\"http://ros.org/wiki/moveit\"\
  >MoveIt!</a> motion planner\n   developers and users. Currently the following items\
  \ are monitored if they\n   are either running, existing or published:\n   <ul>\n\
  \   <li>Node: /move_group</li>\n   <li>Parameter: [/robot_description, /robot_description_semantic]</li>\n\
  \   <li>Topic: Following types are monitored. Published &quot;names&quot; are ignored.<br/>\n\
  \       [sensor_msgs/PointCloud, sensor_msgs/PointCloud2,\n        sensor_msgs/Image,\
  \ sensor_msgs/CameraInfo]</li>\n   </ul>\n   Since this package is not made by the\
  \ MoveIt! development team (although with\n   assistance from the them), please\
  \ post issue reports to the designated\n   tracker (not MoveIt!'s main tracker)."
