description: "tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate\n\
  frames over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate\nframes in a\
  \ tree structure buffered in time, and lets the user\ntransform points, vectors,\
  \ etc between any two coordinate frames at\nany desired point in time.\n\n    <p><b>Migration</b>:\
  \ Since ROS Hydro, tf has been &quot;deprecated&quot; in favor of <a href=\"http://wiki.ros.org/tf2\"\
  >tf2</a>. tf2 is an iteration on tf providing generally the same feature set more\
  \ efficiently. As well as adding a few new features.<br/>\n    As tf2 is a major\
  \ change the tf API has been maintained in its current form. Since tf2 has a superset\
  \ of the tf features with a subset of the dependencies the tf implementation has\
  \ been removed and replaced with calls to tf2 under the hood. This will mean that\
  \ all users will be compatible with tf2. It is recommended for new work to use tf2\
  \ directly as it has a cleaner interface. However tf will continue to be supported\
  \ for through at least J Turtle.\n    </p>"
