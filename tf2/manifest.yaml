description: "tf2 is the second generation of the transform library, which lets\n\
  \    the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2\n    maintains\
  \ the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree\n    structure buffered in\
  \ time, and lets the user transform points,\n    vectors, etc between any two coordinate\
  \ frames at any desired\n    point in time."
