# Nodes

These are the [ROS Nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes) provided by this package.
Most likely, you will use a launch file to run these. You can also run them
by using `rosrun`:

```shell
rosrun rktl_autonomy <Node name>
```

## cartpole_env

This node creates a connection between the CartPole-v0 environment from OpenAI's
Gym library and ROS for testing and simulation purposes. It subscribes to the
`cartpole/action` topic, which receives a message containing an action (an
integer) that is taken by the agent. It also publishes messages to the
`cartpole/observation`, `cartpole/reward`, and `cartpole/done` topics, which
contain the current observation (a Float32MultiArray), the current reward (a
Float32), and a Boolean indicating whether the episode is done or not,
respectively.

### Subscribed Topics

- `cartpole/action` ([std_msgs/Int32](/std_msgs/html/msg/Int32.html#http://)):
    The action that should be performed.

### Published Topics

- `cartpole/observation` ([std_msgs/Float32MultiArray](/std_msgs/html/msg/Float32MultiArray.html#http://)):
    Observation of the system at any given point.
- `cartpole/reward` ([std_msgs/Float32](/std_msgs/html/msg/Float32.html#http://)):
    Reward for training.
- `cartpole/done` ([std_msgs/Bool](/std_msgs/html/msg/Bool.html#http://)):
    Boolean representing the whether or not the simulation is complete.

## plotter

This node plots the progress of a machine learning algorithm. The progress is
subscribed to via the `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticStatus` message. The node uses
the `mpl_toolkits` library to plot the progress of the training, which is then
saved as a PNG image file.

### Subscribed Topics

- `~log` ([diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticStatus](/diagnostic_msgs/html/msg/DiagnosticStatus.html#http://)):
    Log for the training algorithm.

### Parameters

- `~log/base_dir` (string): The base directory where the training log files are
    stored.
- `~log/plot_freq` (int, default: `25`): The frequency of plotting, i.e., how
    often the node updates the plot with new data.
- `~log/basic` (list, default: `['duration']`): A list of basic variables to
    plot. These variables have only one line on the plot.
- `~log/advanced` (list, default: `['net_reward']`): A list of advanced
    variables to plot. These variables have three lines on the plot: the
    average, the minimum, and the maximum.
- `~frequency` (float, default: `1/30`): Frequency of the main simulation loop.
