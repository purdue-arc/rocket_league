description: "The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to\n\
  \    integrate it tightly with ROS.  For example, SMACH-ROS can call\n    ROS services,\
  \ listen to ROS topics, and integrate\n    with <a href=\"http://www.ros.org/wiki/actionlib\"\
  >actionlib</a>\n    both as a client, and a provider of action servers.  SMACH is\
  \ a\n    new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to\n   \
  \ quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular\n    code."
