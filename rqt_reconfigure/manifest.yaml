description: "This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI\n    (reconfigure_gui),\
  \ and provides the way to view and edit the parameters\n    that are accessible\
  \ via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    (12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary\
  \ parameters that are not associated\n    with any nodes (which are not handled\
  \ by dynamic_reconfigure) might\n    become handled.\n    However, currently as\
  \ the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent\n    on dynamic_reconfigure that\
  \ allows access to only those params latched\n    to nodes."
