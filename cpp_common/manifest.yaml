description: "cpp_common contains C++ code for doing things that are not necessarily\
  \ ROS\n    related, but are useful for multiple packages. This includes things like\n\
  \    the ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_FORCE_INLINE macros, as well as code for getting\n\
  \    backtraces.\n\n    This package is a component of <a href=\"http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp\"\
  >roscpp</a>."
