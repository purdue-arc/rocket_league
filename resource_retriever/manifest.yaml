description: "This package retrieves data from url-format files such as http://,\n\
  \   ftp://, package:// file://, etc., and loads the data into memory.\n   The package://\
  \ url for ros packages is translated into a local\n   file:// url.  The resourse\
  \ retriever was initially designed to load\n   mesh files into memory, but it can\
  \ be used for any type of\n   data. The resource retriever is based on the the libcurl\
  \ library."
