description: 'This package contains a set of conversion functions to convert

  common tf datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into semantically

  identical datatypes used by other libraries. The conversion functions

  make it easier for users of the transform library (tf) to work with

  the datatype of their choice. Currently this package has support for

  the Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen matrix

  library. This package is stable, and will get integrated into tf in

  the next major release cycle (see roadmap).'
