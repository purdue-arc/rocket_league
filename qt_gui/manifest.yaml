description: "qt_gui provides the infrastructure for an integrated graphical user\
  \ interface based on Qt.\n    It is extensible with Python- and C++-based plugins\
  \ (implemented in separate packages) which can contribute arbitrary widgets.\n \
  \   It requires either PyQt or PySide bindings."
