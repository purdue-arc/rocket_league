description: "This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to\n    <a href=\"\
  http://ros.org/wiki/tf2\">tf2</a>. Once the state gets published, it is\n    available\
  \ to all components in the system that also use <tt>tf2</tt>.\n    The package takes\
  \ the joint angles of the robot as input\n    and publishes the 3D poses of the\
  \ robot links, using a kinematic\n    tree model of the robot. The package can both\
  \ be used as a library\n    and as a ROS node.  This package has been well tested\
  \ and the code\n    is stable. No major changes are planned in the near future."
