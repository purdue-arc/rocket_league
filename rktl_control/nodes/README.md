## controller

Customizable controller for the car. It implements either a PID controller or a
lead-lag controller.

The controller is responsible for making the car do what you tell it to do.
Simply, that means you give it a
[`ControlCommand.msg`](/rktl_msgs/html/msg/ControlCommand.html#http://) and it
produces a [`ControlEffort.msg`](/rktl_msgs/html/msg/ControlEffort.html#http://)
that makes the car follow it. At a basic level, it uses the odometry produced by
the filter and tries to minimize the error between what you want the car to do
and what it is actually doing.

The incoming message is different from the outgoing message because it is taking
a desired motion that could be for any mechanism, and it is converting it to
very specific hardware commands for our specific cars. This allows the software
generating the commands to ignore the specifics of the cars, and the software /
hardware getting the efforts to the actuators to also ignore the specifics of
the car as a whole.

The two types of controllers supported are PID and lead-lag. If you've never
heard of these before, PID is going to be something you can intuitively
understand with some work, and lead-lag is probably something you're going to
need to take some classes or read some textbooks to understand (ex: Purdue ME
365, 375, 475).

PID control is very well explained in many places on the internet, so I won't
discuss the basics here. The reason it is an option is because it is a commonly
used controller that can be tuned intuitively by watching how the car is
behaving. Lead-Lag is a very similar algorithm that can result in better
performance (especially for discrete systems like this), but it is harder to
tune. Intuitively tuning likely isn't an option, so instead MATLAB scripts can
be really helpful to determine the specific gains to use. These are included in
the `scripts` directory of this package.

## mean_odom_filter

This is a very simple filter. If you have a stream of noisy measurements,
averaging the most recent $N$ measurements will give you a pretty good estimate.
This gets slightly complicated when handling angles, since they wrap around at
$\pm\pi$, but it still works.

The downside is that if you average 10 measurements, your estimate is
time-delayed by 5 sampling periods. Therefore, a balance needs to be struck
between the desired noise reduction and the acceptable delay.

This filter also runs into problems when taking derivatives of the input. Simply
taking the derivative of the two most recent measurements, filtered or
unfiltered, will result in significant noise. To combat this, the filter computes
derivatives for each pair of points (ex: $t-1$ and $t-2$, $t-2$ and $t-3$, $t-3$
and $t-4$), then averages those velocity predictions using the same averaging
buffer algorithm.

Overall, this filter is simple and works well enough for position as long as slight delay is acceptable. For velocity, it runs into problems since the noise is greater and the sampling frequency isnâ€™t high enough to get a low delay signal.

## particle_odom_filter

This is a much more complex algorithm. The basic premise of why the algorithm is
useful is that by considering the noise in each individual measurement, not just
the mean value, there is more detail that can be used to improve the accuracy vs
delay trade off. Several similar algorithms were considered and are briefly
discussed below.

The basic premise is that a particle filter has many different estimates of what
the car is doing and where it is (called a particle; perhaps 1,000 in this
application). For each new measurement that comes in:

- Each and every one of these particles are simulated one time step (using a
    bicycle model) to get a prediction of the current state of the particle
- For each particle, the question is asked, "Given this measurement and what I
    know about it's standard deviation, what is the probability that this
    particle is correct?"
- That result is used to compute a weighed average of all the particles.
- This average is then post processed a little bit to produce an odometry
    estimate since the internal states don't exactly match

This then repeats until the end of time.

Initially, the particles are randomly distributed all over the field, but they
eventually converge (pretty quickly) to the real state of the car. To do this,
the filter will periodically delete bad particles, and replace them with new
random ones. These random ones are uniformly distributed if there isn't a good
guess of where the car is (like when the filter first starts), or distributed
normally about the most recent guess

The specific state of the car is tracked by five-ish variables:

- $x$, the $x$ location of the car's center of mass in the field's reference frame
- $y$, the $y$ location of the car's center of mass in the field's reference frame
- $\sin(\theta)$, the $y$ component of the car's heading angle in the field's
    reference frame
- $\cos(\theta)$, the $x$ component of the car's heading angle in the field's
    reference frame
- $v_{rear}$, the linear velocity of the rear tires of the car
- $\psi$, the steering angle (relative to the car's center)

$\theta$ is split into two state variables to prevent issues with wrap around
and summation.

From these, a kinematic bicycle model is used to calculate out everything needed
for an [odometry message](/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html#http://). Basically, this
just assumes there is no side-slip by the tires and it uses a lot of
trigonometry. Details are in the MATLAB script [`scripts/bicycle_model.m`].

When advancing each particle one time-step, either the known control vector
(from listening to controller output) or a random control vector is used. If the
known vector is used, a small amount of random noise is added. If a completely
random one is used, they are uniformly distributed between actuator saturation
limits. From these, a new wheel velocity and steering angle are predicted
(using a 1st order and 0 order velocity model) and fed into the bicycle model.

All parameters to the filter are defined in `config/particle_odom_filter.yaml`.
The relevant ones to tweak are:
