description: "A collection of .mk include files for building ROS architectural elements.\n\
  \    Most package authors should use cmake .mk, which calls CMake for the build\
  \ of the package.\n    The other files in this package are intended for use in exotic\
  \ situations that mostly arise when importing 3rdparty code."
